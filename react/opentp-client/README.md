# opentp-client

The opentp client is an SPA client written in Typescript using the React library.  The client provides implementations of the components most commonly found in execution trading clients, these being:  Order Blotter, Order Ticket, Instrument Watch and Market Depth.  In addition it provides components to view Order History and Executions.  These components, along with the applications container, are intended as a guide and base architecture on which customised clients can be built.
